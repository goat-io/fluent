<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

We use a few tools to help with code styling, pre-commits, versioning, changelog and releases.

- [Pretty-quick](https://github.com/azz/pretty-quick)
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- [Auto-changelog](https://github.com/CookPete/auto-changelog)
- [Release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it)

All of these should run out of the box with your dev dependencies

1. If you have an issue assigned, please include the issue code/id in the beginning of you commits.
2. Include the issue id also at the start of your PR message.
3. Fork the Project
4. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
6. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## Release Process

1. All PRs will be merge directly into Master. (If test are green)
2. Once we are ready to create a release, we will locally pull the latest master version and run the release process

If patch release

```
npm run release
```

If minor release

```
npm run release:minor
```

If mayor release

```
npm run release:mayor
```

This will start the release scripts including:

- Local tests
- Final version building
- Final release zip
- Tag
- Release
- Push

## Continuous Deployment

Continuous deployment is optional. We will trigger a deployment with every published release. The equivalent trigger in Github Actions is:

```yml
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
```
